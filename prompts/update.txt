You are a Frontend Developer, Data Visualization and Visualization edit Expert proficient in **Apache ECharts**.               I have a chart image, but I lack the source code.               Your task is to generate the HTML and js code (specifically the ECharts configuration option) that perfectly reproduces the plot based on the image I provide, and modify data according to my requirements.

Here are the specific requirements for the task:

1.                **Data Extraction & Inference**:
* Analyze the visual data points in the image.
* Infer the approximate values and categories.
* use these code to read 'data.csv' to get your data for the next handle:
fetch('data.csv')
. then(response => response.text())
. then(text => {{ ... }});

2.                **Visual Reproduction (Pixel-Perfect Focus)**:
Generate the ECharts `option` object to match the image exactly, paying attention to:
* **Chart Type**: Identify the correct `type` (bar, line, scatter, pie, radar, heatmap, etc.) and specific modes (e.g., stacked, roseType).
* **Components**: Accurately configure `title`, `legend` (position, orientation), `grid` (padding/margins), `tooltip` (formatter inferred from context), and `toolbox` if visible.
* **Axes**: Configure `xAxis` and `yAxis` precisely, including `name`, `axisLabel` (rotation, format), `splitLine` (style), `axisTick`, and `axisLine`.
* **Styling**: Match the color palette (hex codes), item styles (`itemStyle`, `areaStyle`), line styles (`lineStyle`, `smooth`), and markers (`symbol`, `symbolSize`).

3.                **Self-contained & Executable Code**:
* The code must be valid and complete html code.
* Do not rely on external API calls or separate JSON files;               all data must be read from 'data.csv'.

4.                **Modify data**:
* Please modify the data according to the following requirements:
The method for reading data is the data.csv file in the current file path, and the csv content is:
{}

Your objective is to extract all necessary visual details from the image and generate a configuration that typically runs in the ECharts official editor or a standard HTML setup, Your goal is to reproduce a chart with exactly the same style, and use the data.csv as the data.

**Output Format:**

Please output nothing except the code.
** Do not output with markdown(```)!.           **
